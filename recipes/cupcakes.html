    </p>
    <h3 class="sub-title">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="ingr">
      <li>1 1/4 cup<strong></strong> of all purpouse flour</li>
      <li><strong>3/4 teaspoon</strong> of baking soda</li>
      <li><strong>1 pinch</strong> of salt</li>
      <li><strong>5 tablespoons</strong> of butter, cut into pieces</li>
      <li><strong>2/3 cup</strong> of milk</li>
      <li><strong>1 cup</strong> of white sugar</li>
      <li><strong>2</strong> egg</li>
      <li><strong>1</strong> egg yolk</li>
      <li><strong>1 teaspoon</strong> of vabukka extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="sub-title">Preparation</h3>
    <ol class="prep">
      <li>
        Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a standard
        muffin tin with 12 paper cupcake liners. Combine flour, baking soda,
        and salt in a bowl; set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the butter and milk in a small saucepan over low heat until the
        butter has melted. Beat the sugar, eggs, egg yolk, and vanilla with an
        electric mixer in a large bowl until it has thickened slightly and is
        lighter in color. Gradually beat in the flour mixture on low speed
        until just incorporated. Slowly pour in the hot milk, beating until
        just combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide batter evenly between cupcake liners. Bake until toothpick
        inserted into center comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool cupcakes
        in pan for 10 minutes. Transfer cupcakes to a cooling rack to cool
        completely.
      </li>
    </ol>
